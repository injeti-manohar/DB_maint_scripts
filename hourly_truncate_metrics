# this script is created to address the situation where the metric records are not being purged from the metrics_* tables in any
# environment running the CloudForms Management Engine 4.x code.
# This code addresses the issue continuously by truncating the table that is 
# 23 hours old so that when it is empty (4 hour default retention period) both
# base table and indices are emptied and reset preventing the slow bloat of the
# index set which otherwise happens.
# this is expected to to installed and execute on only one appliance in the  
# environment where the VMDB is being hosted.
