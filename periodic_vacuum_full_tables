# # # # # # # #
# this script is intended to perform full vacuum of certain CFME tables periodically
# caution needs to be used with full vacuum as each of these tables will become locked
# for update until the full vacuum is completed. 
#
# the expected operational environment for this script is that it is executing
# on the host/appliance where the CFME PostgreSQL VMDB is executing.  The command
# initiation sequence does not contain either userid or host reference as it
# is expected that the pg_hba.conf is configured to trust linux socket connections
# and not require these.
# 
# Caution: PostgreSQL version 9.0 and later has changed the way that vacuum full
#           operates.  In prior versions, there was no need to have additional
#           space available in the file system to perform vacuum full operations.
#           However, with version 9.0 the vacuum full operation copies the source
#           table (ie the table being vacuumed) to a completely new table which 
#           temporarily increases the required space in the filesystem where the 
#           database exists.  After the copy and rebuild of the indexes is 
#           completed the old tables and indexes are delete and the newly created
#           ones renamed to the old names.

# any single vacuum can be removed by preceding the word "vacuum" with two dashes
# eg "--vacuum full hosts" will prevent the vacuum from operating on the 'hosts'
